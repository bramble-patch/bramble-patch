The Boss is a supervising field agent for the SEA 2 branch of the Committee (AAC).

## Description

The Boss, or just Boss, is a middle aged Malaysian woman who is rarely seen in anything but her mildly illfitting dark grey business suit. She lives in an airstream trailer that doubles as her office. Despite being cramped, she manages roughly 10 other field workers and compiles reports and trail cam data to send to ghosts at other branches. Put briefly, she runs a hotline that takes reports of rogue ghosts and dispatches agents to manage situations. She works with Wrenvault for transportation magics.

The Boss is very friendly and laidback! Like most Committee ghosts, her form appears to be unaltered, and it is clear that she doesn't rely on secret strength or magic/pyschic powers. She talks her way out of most situations and although she gets sick or hurt fairly often, it seems like shes pretty tough and it's hard to do her grevious harm. Boss doesn't really talk about her life beyond her present work, but is always happy to tell people about her weird and kind of gross relationship.

### Trivia

- Boss thinks mithridatism is really cool but doesn't have the dedication to make it work, so she semi-frequently ends up poisoning herself.
- She is in a dicey relationship with 330 Pleasant Pl. which also means she is semi-frequently poisoned.
- The Boss' "sister" is Madam President. Their exact relationship is unknown but everyone on the island can see that they look incredibly alike, Boss is just about 5% larger and a little more untidy. The two are quite noticeabley awkward and stiff around each other.
- Some of her coworkers theorize that she was a rogue ghost before she took her current position (not uncommon for field agents) but they are also doubtful how she would possibly have survived outside of the Committee.
