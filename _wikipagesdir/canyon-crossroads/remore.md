To be a remore is to inhabit the mind and body of another ghost. 

## Overview

Occasionally, for means of protection, a rogue ghost will forfeit their independent physical form and live as a "remore" inside the mind and body of another ghost. It is an exceedingly rare phenomenon and only observed in rogue ghosts. 

Having a remore can increase the hosts power, and give them different skillsets, as they are merging power and abilities with another ghost. There are also pyschological benefits. Most rogue ghosts are antisocial and do not trust other ghosts. The basis of a remore must be trust, or the relationship will implode and one or both parties will be severly injured, and quite possibly permanently destroyed. 

Being a remore allows protection from physical harm and makes the remore incredibly hard to detect. A remore will not waste as long as their host does not waste, and can work with their host to use their abilities to a greater amplitude, now that they have a larger bank of power. It stabilizes the mind and provides like psychological benefits as it does the host. 

This is an extremely intimate relationship. You are asking someone permission to live inside of them. Or they are asking permission to live inside of you. This can affect a ghost in every way imaginable. 

A remore goes unseen much of the time but can manifest physically if they wish. They are clearest and most tangible to their host, and rarely if ever appear to other ghosts. 

### Trivia

- This can not be done unwillingly. Because of the intimate nature of the relationship, both parties MUST agree to coexist.  
- Babyface and The Perfect Wife are one of the few known examples of two ghosts who live in this state. Even then, Committee ghosts are hesitant to discuss it. 
- Every known example (there are three unclassified instances in Committee records throughout all of time) involves two ghosts, but there is no reason to believe there can't be more ghosts involved.
- Some observers have confused this phenomena with Dissasociative Identity Disorder. However, there is no evidence remore cause amnesia or disasociation, nor do they "switch" with their hosts. Additionally, remore are acquired on a specific date, proposed by two parties, that may be corroborated by other witnesses. There is no evidence that DID and remore acquisition are linked.
