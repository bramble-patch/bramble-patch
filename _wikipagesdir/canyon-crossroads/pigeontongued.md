An informal classification for ghosts whose primary language is, in fact, an almagamation of two or more languages. A pigeon language can be considered an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idioglossia>idioglossia</a>.

## Overview 

Pigeon tongued ghosts are generally children who died young, or who experienced regression after death, resulting in young dead in various shakey stages of language acquisition. Young ghosts who would go on to live in communities using various languages interchangeably are more likely to become pigeon tongued, developing a first language that is a mishmash of several languages. There is no formal diagnostic criteria for pigeon tongues, but hobbyists say when at least 20% of a ghosts spoken language differs from the rest, that ghost is pigeon tongued. 

Some pigeon tongues are written but it is much more rare. Pigeon tongued ghosts typically have a harder time learning to write and read because they speak with a very loose grasp on grammar, letting the tongue of the dead convey their meaning. Those that do learn to write often write in a single language, and can not always read aloud their writing. 

### Trivia?

- This term is used by rogue ghosts and Committee ghosts alike. Its name refers to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin">pidgin language</a> although it is not really a correct comparison.
- Small rogue groups of children from a variety of backgrounds, with only intermittent care by adults, seem to be the groups most likely to develope pigeon tongues.  
- Due to the tongue of the dead, use of pigeon languages persists later into life, differing from many idioglossias.
