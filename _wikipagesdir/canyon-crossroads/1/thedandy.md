The Dandy is a frequently sighted rogue ghost. He is not safe to talk to and approach.    
 

## Information

The Dandy is a young man in fancy dress. His costume is not consistent to a specific time period, but unless you have lived through those times and have a particular eye for fashion, it's not very obvious. He has slick dark hair and occasionally wears hats and carries canes or umbrellas. His eyes are obscured but likely do not exist. Surviving victimes report grid-like scratches in the eye socket area with no blood or scarring.

He has been spotted worldwide, usually in rural areas on quiet ghost roads. He tends to hunt near dawn and dusk, and does not appear to use magic, though some speculate he may use enchantments in his voice to catch the attention of travelers. 

He has killed at least 15 Committee ghosts but the number may very well be higher. The Dandy is not safe to talk to. He claims to be very lonely and horribly repentant, which may be true, but everyone who has encountered him reports some kind of violence. Additional reports include mentions of grip strength and pain immunity. He does not stalk victims, and if they get away, they are likely never to see him again. Besides for location and time of attacks, there seems to be no pattern in his victims. 

### Trivia

- The reason he poses such a threat to Committee ghosts is because field agents are compelled to hear him out. The Dandy is a frequent textbook example of a dangerous ghost because of the way he clashes with the nature of most field agents.  
- His requests to field agents are sometimes for food and shelter, but generally he asks to be forgiven.
