Babyface is a rogue ghost with 3 confirmed sightings. 
 

## Information

Babyface is above average human height and weight. She typically wears a porcelain soup bowl with holes bored in it as a mask, and animal skins. 
She uses magic sparingly, mostly in protection runes around her camp carved into lightweight stones. Babyface generally defends herself with her fists and her axe. She is in a relationship (the easiest way to describe it would be romantic) with The Good Wife, her remore.

She has no confirmed Committee victims.

### Trivia

- Babyface once saved Madam President after she passed out in the snow and nursed her back to health for three days before she let her go. It's not clear why. She only spoke two times but Madam President heard her speaking to her remore nearby. 
- Once someone said she was hearding reindeer near their village!   
- She did her own double masectomy, probably with her axe. And sewed herself up.
- Although she's pretty scary, she seems to have a relatively healthy relationship with The Perfect Wife.
